#### For my 5th and final (capstone) project at GA I have decided to explore data visualization libraries in Python. I will try to represent soccer data such as expected goals (xG - yes, that's a thing) and passes made/attempted in the particular match.

### Goals:

- Pull the API stats, filter it out to scale it down for my own needs.
- Write the functions needed and present the data in a reasonable way.

#### Stretch Goal:

- Expand it to diff leagues matches player etc (I would start using one competition and probably one team at the begining and then scale it up as much as the time allows)

#### Stretch Strech Goal:

- Make some kind of data analysis based on the data imported

## For my 5th project at General Assembly I have decided to explore data analysis and visualization libraries in Python.

# TOPIC: "How dominant are Liverpool and Manchester City exactly?"

## Tech Stack:

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Aproach:

Since I am a huge soccer fan and Liverpool FC supporter (YNWA) I have decided to compare Liverpool and Manchester city teams and check their dominance through the numbers in this project. I took last 6 seasons in consideration, only seasons with current managers in charge for the full duration of the season.
Most of the analysis is set up to compare these 2 teams against each other as well as against the average in the Premier League.
For my strech goal I would like to compare them to some of the most dominant sides in the Premier League history.

## MVP:

- Set the hypothesis or question to answer
- Find and download the data
- Prepare, clean and remodel the data if needed
- Filter out the data
- Write the functions needed and modify the data
- Visualize the data and present it with a storyline

## MVP Goals:

- Overal proportion of Win-Draw-Loss
- Goals scored and goals conceded
- Clean Sheet (0 goals conceded) games

## Stretch Goals:

- Shot volumes
- Shots on target volumes and accuracy percentage
- Comparison to some of the most dominant sides in the Premier League ever: Man Utd (2006/07 - 2011/12) and Chelsea (2004/05 - 2009/10)

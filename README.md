### For my 5th and final (capstone) project at GA I have decided to explore data visualization libraries in Python. I will try to present soccer data from the English Premier League.

#### TOPIC: "Liverpool and Manchester City dominance since Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola were hired."

#### Goals:

- Find and download the data
- Clean the data and change the data types if needed
- Filter out data
- Write the functions needed for modifying the data
- Present the data in the best way possible
- Use Google Colaboratory for deploying
